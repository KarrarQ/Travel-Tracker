# Where to NXT - Travel Tracker

## `Overview`

Jet Set Go is a travel tracking app developed by [Karrar Qasim](https://github.com/KarrarQ). This is the final solo project for Mod 2 of [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.io/)'s front-end engineering program. This application uses Object Oriented Programming to drive the design and codebase of the application, and it works with an API to send and receive data. A detailed spec for the assignment can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html).

### `Goals`
The goals of this project were to:
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code.
- Work with an API to send and receive data.
- Solidify the code review process.
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

### `Running ExploreX`
- `git clone` the repo down to your machine.
- `cd` into the repository.
- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm start`.
- `git clone` the API repository needed [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api).
- `cd` into the repository.
- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm start`.
- Check both are running in your local machine. 
- Go back to your browser and enter https://localhost:8080 in the search bar to access the frontend of the application.

### `Visual of Functionality:`


### `Challenges`
- Timing Asynchronous Javascript.

 ### `Wins!`
 - Being able to implement Fetch requests to POST and GET data.
 - Building out class and test structures.
 - Creating all separte files for API calls, DOM manipulation.
 - Implementing Asynchronous JavaScript.

### `Technologies Used:`
- Javascript
- HTML
- Mocha & Chai
- Local API
- Node.js & NPM
- Webpack

### `Future Goals`
- DRY up some of the Javascript
- Optimize code for faster load times and performance
- Check some elements of accessibility, including testing with a screenreader
- Flesh out sad path testing
- Add a logout feature
